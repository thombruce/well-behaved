Hi there, hello world, and welcome... to _Well Behaved_, my excuse to not be. _Well Behaved_ is a deliberate misnomer, a contradiction at odds with my intentions, an oxymoron by proxy. See, there's such a thing as good writing, as well-behaved websites and code, and I've got a few projects on the go where I'm aiming for that sort of thing...

_Actually, let's not bother listing them._ The key point is this: I agonise sometimes over where my writing fits, and where I should be writing some of the code that I want to be writing. I mean... in both fields, there are things which fit in certain scopes and I've tried to refine my works to fit into a certain subset of scopes... but what if some things don't fit? What if I just want to journal? What if I just want to mess around and... make a quick widget to show something off? What if those things don't necessitate whole additional scopes of their own? My answer...

_Well Behaved_

An excuse to write poorly with no target length, no specific genres or topics. And an excuse to write code for the sake of writing code instead of... refining it and making it fit neatly into little packages. Things that start here might evolve into concepts developed elsewhere, and that's fine - that's the point! I just don't necessarily have the space for that right now, but this can be that space.

And speaking of having no target length and not having to play by the rules...
