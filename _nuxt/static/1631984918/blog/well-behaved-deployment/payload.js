Each GitHub repo gets precisely one GitHub pages site; it can be based on any branch or directory (I think) in the repo, but there can only be one.

GitHub Pages has additional limitations on site size, at 1GB recommended repository size and 1GB limit on deployed site size. The main limiting factor on Netlify is build time - it stacks up quickly. On GitHub, build time is limited to 10 builds per hour but there's no limit on time used per month for free, open-source projects.
